## 1. What you need

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| An MU2000 | Needed to extract the ROMs. **ROMs are not distributed**; you take them from your own unit |
| A PC | Windows (x86-64), macOS (Apple silicon) or Linux. The whole MU2000 is emulated, so it uses real CPU (about 21% of real time on a 16-part song, Ryzen 7 9700X). **That share is machine-dependent** — it scales with single-core speed, so an older machine can be 2-3× that |
| A USB cable | For extracting the wave ROM (no MIDI interface needed) |
| A virtual MIDI cable | To drive the standalone app from a sequencer. On Windows, loopMIDI ([domino.md](domino.md)) |

**Never upload or share anything taken from the hardware (ROM images, firmware, `.ydl` files containing it).**
Hashes, logs, MIDI files and recordings are enough for bug reports. See the
[notice in the README](../README.md#hardware-derived-data-do-not-distribute-or-post).

## 2. Preparing the ROMs

Two ROMs are needed. Procedures and tools: [dump/README.md](dump/README.md).

| ROM | How to get it |
|---|---|
| Program ROM (4MB) | **No extraction needed.** Rebuild it from Yamaha's updater `mu2r1_uw.zip` with `tools/dump/ydl_extract.py` |
| Wave ROM (32MB) | About 36 minutes over one USB cable. A custom dumper is flashed to the unit and reads the ROM out (the official updater restores the unit at any time, but flashing is at your own risk) |

Put the results in one folder (the "rom folder"):

```
roms/
  mu2000_flash.bin        program ROM
  dump/xv364a0.ic49 etc.  wave ROM, 4 × 8MB
  standin/sin-table.bin   sine table used by the MEG
```

## 3. Building

C++20 is required on all platforms.

### Windows

Use g++ and make from the MSYS2 MINGW64 environment.
[You can download MSYS2 here.](https://www.msys2.org/)

Once installed, open the `MSYS2 MINGW64` application and type

```bash
make
```

This builds the executables located in `build/`:

| Output | What it is |
|---|---|
| `build/gui.exe` | The standalone app with a hardware-style panel (the one you will use most) |
| `build/S-MU2000.vst3/` | VST3 plugin |
| `build/S-MU2000.clap` | CLAP plugin |
| `build/live.exe` | Plays incoming MIDI without a window |
| `build/render.exe` | Renders a MIDI file to WAV (**Standard MIDI Files only**, format 0 and 1; convert RCP/XWS to SMF first) |

The Windows executables do not depend on MSYS2 DLLs, so they run from plain PowerShell or Explorer.

### Linux

The standalone `gui`, the VST3 and the CLAP all build on Linux. Install the dependencies first —
on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libasound2-dev libcairo2-dev libfontconfig-dev libsdl3-dev
```

on Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -Sy base-devel alsa-lib cairo fontconfig sdl3
```

then:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

This produces, in `build-linux/` (a separate directory, so object files never mix with a Windows
build in a shared tree):

| Output | What it is |
|---|---|
| `build-linux/gui` | The standalone app with a hardware-style panel (SDL3 window; F2/F3 open the PC windows) |
| `build-linux/S-MU2000.vst3/` | VST3 plugin |
| `build-linux/S-MU2000.clap` | CLAP plugin |
| `build-linux/live` | Plays incoming MIDI without a window (ALSA) |
| `build-linux/render` | Renders a MIDI file to WAV (same SMF-only note as above) |

Start it with `build-linux/gui roms`. Details: [linux.md](linux.md) (Japanese).

### macOS

Use Apple clang++ and make. `make` builds the tools plus both plugin bundles in `build/`
(`gui`, `live`, `render`, `S-MU2000.vst3/`, `S-MU2000.component/`).

macOS differences: [porting-macos.md](porting-macos.md).

## 4. Standalone (`gui`)

### Starting

```bash
build/gui.exe C:\path\to\roms   # Windows
build-linux/gui roms             # Linux
build/gui roms                   # macOS
```

After a few seconds the LCD shows the play screen (e.g. `◀000▶001 GrandP #01`), just like powering on the hardware.
**Later starts are faster** (the fully booted state is cached and reloaded).

### Choosing MIDI ports

**Left-click the `MIDI IN A` jack** drawn on the panel, or right-click anywhere in the window. You can change ports while running.

| Port | Parts |
|---|---|
| MIDI IN A | 1-16 |
| MIDI IN B | 17-32 |
| MIDI IN C | 33-48 (USB-only on the hardware) |
| MIDI IN D | 49-64 (same) |
| MIDI OUT | What the MU2000 itself sends (dump replies etc.) |
| MIDI THRU A / B | Passes received MIDI straight out (for A/B comparison with real hardware) |

To play from a sequencer such as Domino, create a port in loopMIDI and select it on both sides
([domino.md](domino.md)). Ports are remembered **by name**, so you only choose them once.
On Linux the app creates one ALSA sequencer port (`S-MU2000`); wire it up from the terminal
with `aconnect` (details: [linux.md](linux.md), Japanese).

### Audio output and latency

Click the **PHONES jack** on the front panel and open **Audio output device**
(also available in the panel's right-click menu). Pick your speakers, headphones,
or **System default**. The output switches immediately without rebooting the MU2000
and the choice is remembered. The list is refreshed whenever the menu opens;
after connecting or disconnecting a device, reopen the menu. If the new device
cannot be opened, an error is shown and the previous output is restored if available.
This picker is shared by the Windows, macOS and Linux standalone apps. Plugin
output devices are controlled by the DAW. The PHONES digital/analog options
still control the emulated output processing separately.

Choose the output device at startup with `--audio "part of the name"` (list names with `--list`).
It is remembered afterwards.

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--exclusive` | Exclusive mode. Lowest latency (measured 16ms); other apps cannot play audio meanwhile |
| `--latency 10` | Buffer length in milliseconds. Increase it if audio drops out |

Setting the audio interface to 44100Hz with a 256-sample buffer avoids resampling and extra delay.
On Linux `--exclusive` has no effect (ALSA has no exclusive mode); pick the device with `--audio`
(default: `default`).
Details: [README, Latency](../README.md#latency).

### Playing MIDI files

**Drop a MIDI file on a window**, or start with `--play song.mid`. Stop it from the menu of the card slot
("止める"). Songs with four ports are routed to A-D according to each track's port meta event (`FF 21`).

`Player` on the bar at the top of the window opens the **MIDI player window**: a playlist (add any number of files,
drag to reorder), pause, previous/next, loop modes (none, list, one song, shuffle), a position slider for seeking,
and a bar/beat/tempo display. Seeking first sends the settings up to that point (SysEx, programs, controllers)
and then plays on ([gui.en.md](gui.en.md)).

### Settings persist

MU2000 settings (utility settings, master volume, ...) survive restarts, like the battery-backed RAM of
the hardware. To reset to factory state, choose "工場出荷状態に戻す..." from the right-click menu, or start with `--factory`.

## 5. The front panel

It works like the real front panel; the LCD shows exactly what the firmware writes.

| Part | How to use |
|---|---|
| Buttons | Click. Also on the keyboard (table below) |
| Big dial | **Mouse wheel**, or drag up/down. Same as VALUE −/+ |
| VOLUME | Drag, or wheel over it. Final output level applied outside the synth |
| Card slot (bottom left) | Create / insert / eject SmartMedia; play and stop MIDI files |
| A/D INPUT jack | Choose the recording device used for sampling |
| PHONES jack | Choose the audio output device (standalone), and digital or analog output behaviour |

| Key | Button |
|---|---|
| `A` `E` `U` `F` | PLAY, EDIT, UTIL, EFFECT |
| `Q` `M` | SEQ, SAMPLING |
| `S` | MUTE/SOLO |
| `[` `]` | PART −/+ |
| `-` `=` | VALUE −/+ |
| `,` `.` | SELECT ◀ ▶ |
| `Enter` `BackSpace` | ENTER, EXIT |
| `Z` `X` | AUDITION, SELECT |
| `F2` `F3` | Editor window, list window |

SmartMedia cards are PC files (`.img`); `tools/smcard.py` copies WAV files in and out.
**Sampling — recording through A/D INPUT and playing it back over MIDI — is walked through in [sampling.md](sampling.md)** (Japanese).
The panel artwork (positions, colours, SVG art) can be changed without rebuilding ([panel-editing.md](panel-editing.md)).
More about the screens: [gui.en.md](gui.en.md).

## 6. PC editor windows

Besides the panel there are mouse-and-keyboard windows for XG parameters. Closing one only hides it;
it reopens as it was. Details: [pc-editor.md](pc-editor.md).

| Window | How to open | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| **List** | F3, right-click | Watching all parts while a song plays and balancing voices, levels and effects |
| **Part voice** | Double-click a VIB / FILTER / EG / EQ graphic in the list | Choosing a voice for one part and shaping vibrato, filter, EG and EQ by dragging points. Playable from the PC keyboard |
| **Insertion effect** | Double-click an INS badge, or INS 1-4 in the master row | Per-type parameters of insertion 1-4 as effect-pedal style knobs |
| **Master** | Double-click the MASTER name or the MASTER EQ graphic in the master row | Master volume, transpose, reverb / chorus / variation types and returns, master EQ |
| **Editor** | F2, right-click | A provisional table-and-knob layout (to be redesigned) |

### List

One row per part. VOL, PAN, VAR, CHO and REV can be changed by **dragging, the mouse wheel, or double-clicking to type**.
Right-click the part name for voices; right-click the INS cell to add or remove effects or choose the type.
INS badges (`1`-`4`, `V`) can be **dragged to another part** to move the effect. M mutes, S solos.
The keyboard can be played with the mouse. Polyphony (`発音 112/128 (M:64, S:48)`) and CPU load are shown top right.
Use `-` `+` at the top to change the display size.

### Part voice

* Pick a category and voice on the left. Each change plays a one-second audition note
* Drag points in the four graphics on the right (VIB: rate and depth; FILTER: cutoff and resonance; EG: attack, decay, release; EQ: frequency and gain). The sliders below do the same
* The top pane shows effect types, VOL-REV bars and a keyboard
* **Right-click a key to place a green marker**; auditions play that note
* The slot at the left end of the keyboard is a **modulation wheel**: hover and use the mouse wheel, or drag up/down
* **Play from the PC keyboard**: `A` `W` `S` `E` `D` `F` `T` `G` `Y` `H` `U` `J` `K` `O` `L` `P` `;` are chromatic from C. `Z` / `X` shift the octave down / up
* Clicking another row in the list switches this window to that part

### Insertion effect

The top strip switches INS 1-4 and chooses the type and the part it is applied to. Knobs: drag up/down (Shift for fine),
mouse wheel, or double-click to type. Types with EQ show a response graph.
Effect types carry a small icon per category (reverb, delay, distortion, EQ, ...).

### Help and language

Tick "説明を出す" (show help) at the top to get a description of the hovered item. Languages: Japanese and English.

## 7. Using it in a DAW (VST3, CLAP, AU)

The engine is the same as the standalone app, and so is **the screen** (right-click the panel to open the list and other windows).
Details: [vst3.en.md](vst3.en.md).

### Installing

```bash
make install-vst3
```

```bash
make install-clap
```

| Format | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| VST3 | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common\VST3` (current user) or `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3` (all users) | `~/.vst3` |
| CLAP | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Common\CLAP` or `C:\Program Files\Common Files\CLAP` | `~/.clap` |

On macOS the VST3 goes to `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3`; build the Audio Unit with `make au`
(installed to `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`).

### Telling the plugin where the ROMs are

The ROMs are 36MB, so instead of copying them, put a **`roms.txt` containing the folder path on one line**.

| Format | Where `roms.txt` goes |
|---|---|
| VST3 | `Contents/Resources/roms.txt` inside the bundle |
| CLAP | Next to `S-MU2000.clap`, or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\S-MU2000\roms.txt` |

```
C:\path\to\roms
```

The environment variable `S_MU2000_ROMS` also works. On Linux, `~/.local/share/S-MU2000/roms.txt`
is also searched (for installs under `~/.vst3` / `~/.clap`).

### After inserting

* **It is silent for a few seconds** while the MU2000 boots, as with the hardware. MIDI received meanwhile is queued and played afterwards.
  The `Status` parameter goes `Booting` → `Ready` (`No ROM` means the ROMs were not found)
* There are **four MIDI input buses** (`MIDI In A (Part 1-16)` to `MIDI In D (Part 49-64)`); choose one per track
* `Output` is the output level
* An auxiliary audio input bus for A/D INPUT is available (hosts usually show it as a sidechain)

### Saving and automation

* Saving the project stores **voices, effects and everything edited on screen**
* Part volume, pan, sends, filter, EG, vibrato and EQ (64 parts × 19), master values (27) and
  insertion 1-4 parameters (4 × 16) are exposed as **named parameters** for automation
* Edits made on the plugin screen are recorded as automation too (VST3, CLAP)

Names and IDs: [automation.md](automation.md). Host-specific notes: [sonar.md](sonar.md), [reason.md](reason.md).

### plugin.ini

Write it at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\S-MU2000\plugin.ini` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/S-MU2000/plugin.ini`).
Takes effect when the plugin is loaded again.

| Line | Effect |
|---|---|
| `usb=0` | Start with the DIN ports (A and B, 32 parts) instead of the USB ports (A-D) |
| `threaded=0` | Run the second tone generator chip inside the host's audio thread instead of the plugin's own thread |

## 8. Where settings are stored

Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\S-MU2000\`. macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/S-MU2000/`.
Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/S-MU2000/` (or `~/.local/share/S-MU2000/`).

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `gui.ini` | gui.exe MIDI ports, audio output, VOLUME, inserted card, ... |
| `editor.ini` | PC window display size, help language, audition note, ... |
| `plugin.ini` | Plugin startup options (above) |
| `nvram\` | MU2000 settings (battery-backed RAM). Written by gui.exe and live.exe; plugins only read it |
| `boot\` | Cached booted state. Safe to delete; rebuilt on the next start |
| `log.txt` | Plugin log, including where ROMs were searched |
| `roms.txt` | ROM location for plugins (CLAP etc.) |

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
|---|---|
| The plugin makes no sound | The `Status` parameter and `log.txt`. `No ROM` means check the path in `roms.txt` |
| No sound right after inserting | Boot wait (a few seconds), same as the hardware |
| Every voice in a song becomes piano | Voice selections arrived before boot finished. Wait for boot before playing |
| Parts 33-64 are silent | Make sure it started with USB ports (the standalone app without `--host-midi`; no `usb=0` in plugin.ini) |
| "MIDI が多すぎるので捨てた" (too much MIDI, dropped) | A MIDI loop between the DAW and loopMIDI. Check THRU routing |
| A port won't open / startup seems stuck | loopMIDI or a driver is hung. Restart loopMIDI or replug the device |
| Audio drops out | Increase `--latency`. Check the interface buffer and sample rate (44100Hz) |
| Start from a clean state | "工場出荷状態に戻す..." in the right-click menu, or `--factory` |

Report problems in [Issues](https://github.com/tarboh/S-MU2000/issues). Do not attach ROMs or firmware;
attach hashes, `log.txt`, MIDI files and recordings instead.
