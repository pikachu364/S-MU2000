// The five PC windows every front end hosts (overview, editor, insertion
// settings, part voice, master), driven the same way everywhere.
//
// gui.exe, gui (macOS), and the VST3/CLAP/AU plug-ins on both platforms each
// repeated the same dozen lines: one frame() per window per tick, then the
// double-click follow-ups from the overview. Only opening a window differs
// per host (show() takes an owner handle on Windows, none on macOS, and each
// side reports failure its own way), so the caller passes that in and this
// stays platform-neutral: it never includes either pc_window.h, and the
// window type is duck-typed. Nothing else about the hosts moves here --
// menus, function keys, file drops, shutdown order and the card slot stay
// where they are, which is what keeps the standalone extras intact.

// One tick for all five windows. Invisible windows cost nothing (each
// frame() returns early while hidden). The overview asks for the insertion,
// part-voice or master window by double-click; open() shows it, however the
// host shows windows
//
// Each of these windows has an ImGui context of its own, and both frame() and
// open() leave that context current -- frame() calls SetCurrentContext, and
// open() creates it, which makes it current too. That is fine on its own, but
// this runs from *inside* the panel's frame: the panel is drawn by ImGui, and
// paint_main() calls us between the window's NewFrame() and Render(). Handing
// the panel's Render() to an editor's context strands the panel's own frame --
// nothing ever ends it -- and the next NewFrame() then asserted "Forgot to
// call Render() or EndFrame() at the end of the previous frame?", the moment
// any PC window was opened. So the panel's context goes back afterwards, and
// the editors keep theirs to themselves.
