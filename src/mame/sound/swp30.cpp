TODOs:
  - 7 bits are still not understood in the MEG instructions
  - in the lfo, the top of slot 9 is not understood
  - slot b is not understood but used (and even read at times)
  - some instruments from the demo don't work well (not sure which)
  - there seems to be some saturation at times in the demo
  - lots of control registers are not understood, in particular
    the 5x ones, one of which is used in the talk mod effect
  - the timing of communication between the meg registers and the
    the environment is known but not implemented


  The SWP30 is the combination of a rompler called AWM2 (Advanced
  Wave Memory 2) and an effects DSP called MEG (Multiple Effects
  Generator).  It also includes some routing/mixing capabilities,
  moving data between AWM2, MEG and serial inputs (MELI) and
  outputs (MELO) with volume management capabilities everywhere.
  Its clock is 33.9MHz and the output is at 44100Hz stereo (768
  cycles per sample pair) per dac output.

  I/O wise, the chip has 8 generic audio serial inputs and 8
  outputs for external plugins, and two dac outputs, all
  stereo. The MU100 connects a stereo ADC to the first input, and
  routes the third input and output to the plugin board.


    Registers:

  The chip interface presents 4096 16-bits registers in a 64x64 grid.
  They are mostly read/write.  Some of this grid is for per-channel
  values for AWM2, but parts are isolated and renumbered for MEG
  registers or for general control functions.


    AWM2:

  The AWM2 is in charge of handling the individual channels.  It
  manages reading the rom, decoding the samples, applying volume and
  pitch envelopes and lfos and filtering the result.  Each channel is
  then sent as a mono signal to the mixer for further processing.

  It is composed of a number of blocks, please refer to the individual
  documentations further in the file:
  - streaming
  - dual special filters
  - dual iir1 filters
  - envelope control
  - lfo

  The sound data can be four formats (8 bits, 12 bits, 16 bits, and
  a 8-bits kinda-apdcm format).  The rom bus is 25 bits address and
  32 bits data wide.  It applies four filters to the sample data in
  two dual filter blocks.  The first block has two filters
  configurable between iir1 and chamberlain, lpf, hpf, band or
  notch, with our without configurable resonance.  The second block
  is two free iir1 filters.  Envelopes are handled automatically,
  and the final result is sent to the mixer for panning, volume
  control and routing.  In addition lfo acts on the pitch and the
  volume.


    MEG:

  The MEG is a DSP with 384 program steps connected to a reverb
  samples ram.  It computes all the effects and sends to result to
  the adcs and the serial outputs.


    Mixer:

  The mixer gets the outputs of the AWM2, the MEG (for the previous
  sample) and the external inputs, attenuates and sums them
  according to its mapping instructions, and pushes the results to
  the MEG and the external outputs.

The streaming block manages reading and decoding samples from rom
and/or dram at a given pitch and format.  The samples are
interpolated for a better quality.

Addresses 000000-ffffff are in rom (and maybe sram?),
1000000-1ffffff are in dram.

The unknown bit in the 010001 slot tends to be set when reading a
compressed sample and unset otherwise.  It does not seem to impact
the result though.  The unknown bit in the 010010 slot doesn't seem
to ever been set in the mu100 and does not seem to impact the
result.

  Sample formats

Samples can be in one of four formats, 8 bits, 12
bits, 16 bits and adaptive-delta-compression with 8 bits per
sample.  Non-compressed samples are zero-extended on the right to
get a almost-full-range 16-bits value.

The compressed format uses a running delta and an accumulator.  The
input byte is expanded into a 10-bit signed value through a fixed
table, which is added to the current delta.  The delta is then
added to the accumulator, which gives the current sample value.
Then the current delta is, depending on the mode bits, multiplied
by either 0.875 (7/8), 0.75 (3/4), 0.5 (1/2) or 0 (e.g. cleared).

The multiplier on the delta is buggy and bias towards negative
numbers, but it's not entirely clear how exactly.  Even worse, the
multiplier results change depending on whether the scaling is zero
or non-zero, and also has some kind of context or extra state bits
hidden somewhere.


  Sample scaling

Samples just read are then shifted left by Scaling bits (0-7).
While the scaling is in practice only used for compressed samples,
the hardware applies it to any format.  The result is clamped
between -0x8000 and a value depending on the amount of scaling
(0x7fff for 0, 0x7ffe for 1, ..., 0x7f80 for 7).


  Sample addressing, pitching and looping

The chip has two 25-bits address, 16-bits data buses to the sample
roms and drams.  The samples are interleaved between the two buses,
looking as if the data bus was 32 bits wide.  It directly manages
dram signals, so there must be a way somewhere for it to tell
whether a sample address is in dram or not.  When in dual-chip
configuration, the address and data lines of the buses are directly
connected, so they have a way to arbitrate their accesses.  The
amount of data needed at a given time varying depending on pitch
and sample format, the design of the memory access controller must
have been interesting.

The current sample position is in signed 25.15 format.  The initial
value of the sample position is minus the number of samples before
the loop point (unsigned 24 bits, slots 010010 and 010011).  It is
incremented by the unsigned 7.15 step value for each sample, until
it reaches a positive value more or equal to the loop size
(unsigned 24 bits, slots 010100 and 010101).  Then if looping is
enabled the position is decreased by the loop size and incremented
by the loop size adjust, otherwise the last sample value output is
held and a maximum speed envelope release is triggered.

The loop size adjust is a 0.6 unsigned value (e.g. between 0 and
0.984375).

Looping is enabled when L=0 (slot 010010) and b=0 (slot 010110).

The unsigned 7.15 step is computed from the pitch and the finetune
values.  The base step value is 2**pitch with pitch encoded as a
signed 4.10 value, e.g. giving a result between 1/256 and almost
but not quite 256.  The exponentiation table has 13 bits of
precision including the left 1 bit.  The finetune is a signed value
between -64 and +63 that is added to the pitch once position 0 is
reached.

Backwards sample reading negates the sample position value before
fetching.  Note that backwards reading disable looping.

Samples are read with sample pos 0 corresponding to the bottom
sample at the 25-bits address. It is important to note that four
consecutive sample values are required for the interpolation block,
and the hardware manages to provide the correct values even for
compressed samples with large steps, requiring to compute and
accumulate the deltas for all the bytes on the way.  The memory
controller must be REALLY interesting.

A pitch skip bigger than the loop size ends up with results
somewhere between weird and utterly insane.  Don't do that.


  Sample interpolation

Samples go through an interpolator which uses two past samples and
two future samples to compute the final value for a non-integer
position, with a weight for each history sample.  The weights are
computed from two polynoms:
  f0(t) = (t - t**3)/6
  f1(t) = t + (t**2 - t**3)/2

The polynoms are used with the decimal part 'p' (as in phase) of
the sample position.  The computation from the four samples s0..s3
is:
  s = - s0 * f0(1-p) + s1 * f1(1-p) + s2 * f1(p) - s3 * f0(p)

f0(0) = f0(1) = f1(0) = 0 and f1(1) = 1, so when phase is 0 (sample
streaming with no frequency shifting) the sample s1 is output.

The implementation of the weights uses two tables with apparently
2048 entries and 10 bits precision (e.g. between 0 and 0.999), but
are in reality 1023 entries.  Each entry of the 1023-entries tables
goes to slots 2n-1 and 2n (n=1..1023), and slots 0 and 2047 are
hardcoded to both 0 for f0 and 0/1.0 for f1. That way the tables
can be used in both directions and the computation of 1-p consists
of inverting all the bits.

The two-past sample for the first position, the first pointed at by
the streamer, is forced to zero.

Post-interpolation, the output is a 16-bits signed value with no
decimals.

This block takes samples from the streaming block and applies two
recursive filters to them.  The type of filter and its coefficient
encoding depends on the 4-bits mode.  Filter 1 has encoded
parameters a and b, filter 2 has c and d.  First parameter is 11
bits and the second 5.  A first paramter of 0 disables the
associated filter.



  Volumes

Three attenuations are used, in 4.4 format.

Attenuation u in slot 000001 is the bypass/dry level, adding an
attenuated version of the input directly the output.

Attenuation v in slot 000011 is the filter 1 level, attenuating its
output before summing to the block output.

//
// The envelope block manages the final volume of an awm2 voice and
// allows to automatically run it through four steps:
// - Attack, climbing up from a programmed value to global volume with a slowing down curve
// - Decay 1, going down to a target volume in a linear fashion
// - Decay 2, going up or down to another target in a linear fashion
// - Release, going down to silence in a linear fashion
//
// The global volume, though, is taken into account by adding it to
// the raw envelope volume.  Hence attack actually targets 0, and the
// levels reached by the decays are the given target plus the global
// volume.
//
// The volume itself is a 14-bit 4.10 attenuation which is manipulated
// as a single number by this block.  An idle voice has stage release
// and volume 3fff.  Start volume, targets and global volume are 4.4,
// hence just zero-extended on the right.
//
// Volume modification uses a concept of speed.  At each sample a
// value is added depending on the speed and a cycle:
// - Speed 78+:    value is always 7f
//
// - Speed 70..77: value alternates between 3f and 7f on a 8-samples
//                 cycle with seven 7f on speed 77, six on 76, etc up
//                 to only 3f on 70.
//
// - Speed 48..6f: same cycles with changing pair for every 8 speeds,
//                 going 1f/3f then f/1f all the way down to 1/3.
//
// - Speed 40..47: 16-samples cycles alternating 0 and 1, where on
//                 every two-sample block there is a 1 and then either a
//                 0 or a 1.  Speed 47 has one 0, 46 has two, all the way
//                 down to 40 which is 50% 0.
//
// - Speed 38..3f: cycles of size 2*16, where in each block of 2 cycles there
//                 may be one 1 depending on the cycle. Goes from
//                 fifteen 1 (out of thirty-two) on speed 3f to eight ones on
//                 speed 38.
//
// - Speed 00..37: same cycles with bigger blocks, going size 4 for 30..37 up
//                 to size 32 for 00..07.
//
// Phase on the cycles seems unpredictable.
//
// Decay 1, Decay 2 and Release use directly the speed as programmed
// (with Release inverting bit 7).  Speeds 80+ gives someone weird
// results, with steps still of 7f but sometimes acting on the target
// level.  Attack uses the given speed but adds to it bits 9..13 of
// the volume multiplied by 4, giving a fast curve at the start which
// decelerates when approaching maximum volume.
//
// Sequencing is automatic.  If release speed is non-zero at keyon
// then the chip will ride the attack from is start value to 0, then
// go to the two decay values then all the way to 3fff on release.  If
// release speed is zero, it will hold still when reaching the end of
// decay 2.  At any time if a non-zero value is written to release
// speed and the envelope is not yet in the release stage then the
// chip switches to release.
//
// A 16-bits readonly register gives the main cpu the current stage
// and raw envelope volume (without the global volume added), with
// stages numbered 0 to 3 in the two top bits and the volume in the
// bottom 14.

LFO block

  cccccc 000101  .... .... .aaa aaaa       LFO amplitude depth
  cccccc 001010  tt.s ssss mppp pppp       LFO type, step, pitch mode, pitch depth

The LFO is a slow oscillator with a period between 0.2 and 6
seconds (0.17 to 5.2Hz).  It starts with a 18-bits counter which is
initialized to a random value on keyon.  At each sample the value
of step is added to the counter.  When sep is zero, the counter is
frozen.  In addition, somewhere in every 0x4000 block at a somewhat
unpredictable time, the counter jumps by an extra 0x40.  The final
period thus ends up being 0x3fc00/step cycles, or between 8423 and
261120 cycles.

From the 18-bits counter a 12-bit state value is created.  How
depends on the type:

 Type 0 (saw);  state is bits 6-17 of the counter

 Type 1 (triangle): state is bits 6-16 of the counter followed by a
    zero if bit 17 = 0, inverted bits 6-16 followed by a zero if
    bit 17 = 1

 Type 2 (rectangle): state is 0 if bit 17 = 0, fff if bit 17 = 1

 Type 3 (sample&hold): state is random, changes of value when bits
    9-17 change

 Amplitude LFO.  The current value of the state is multiplied by
 the amplitude depth (zero hence makes it disabled) and divided by
 0x20, giving a 14-bit, 4.10 attenuation (same format as for the
 envelope).

 Pitch LFO.  The value of the state minus 0x400 is multiplied by
 the pitch depth.  It is then shifted by 8 in coarse mode (m=1) and
 11 in fine mode (m=0).  The resulting signed value is added to the
 pitch used by the streaming block.

The mixer block ensures mixing and routing in the whole system,
between the AM2, the MEG, and the MELI/MELO streams.  The values
passing through are all 27-bits wide.

It has 96 mono inputs:
  - 64 outputs of the AWM2 block, numbered 0-63
  - 16 outputs of the MEG, numbered 64-79, which are read from MEG
    registers m20-m2f
  - 16 inputs (8 stereo) on the MELI ports, numbered 80-95

It has 16 stereo outputs:
  - 8 outputs on the MELO ports, numbered 0-7
  - 8 outputs to the MEG as 16 mono streams, numbered 8-15, which
    are written to MEG registers m20-m2f

Six 8-bit values provide attenuations, and three 16-bits values
provide routing for each of the 96 inputs to each of the 16
outputs.

For a given source, target pair the three bits of routing target
are interpreted following in the following way:

         210
      0: 000 - Not routed
      1: 001 - No attenuation, add to both channels
      2: 010 - No attenuation, add to left channel
      3: 011 - No attenuation, add to right channel
      4: 100 - Use attenuation slot 0
      5: 101 - Use attenuation slot 1
      6: 110 - Use attenuation slot 2
      7: 111 - Use attenuation slot 3

The attenuation slots are built from the six attenuation values.
Attenuation for a given channel (left/right) and a slot (0-3) is
the sum of the left/right attenuation and the slot attenuation.
Final value is 4.4 with >= ff hardcoded to mute.

There is space in the map for channels number 96-127.  The MUs
never touch that space, it seems that it may have (mostly negative)
impacts on the adc outputs (MEG registers m30-m33).

//      General structure

//   The MEG is a DSP with 384 program steps connected to a 0x40000
//   samples ram.  Instructions are 64 bits wide, and to each
//   instruction is associated a 1.15 fixed point signed value
//   (between -1 and 1), Every third instruction (pc multiple of 3)
//   can initiate a memory access to the reverb buffer which will be
//   completed two instructions later.  Each of those instructions is
//   associated to a 16-bits address offset value.

//   The main computation unit is a MAC cell which multiplies two
//   numbers and adds a third.

//   Every 44100th of a second the 384 program steps are run once in
//   order (no branches) to compute everything.


//      Registers

//   The DSP has multiple register sets:

//   - 127 standard registers (bank 'r') numbered 01-7f, with the extra
//     register number 00 being hardwired to 0 (like in mips)

//   - 63 mmio registers (bank 'm') numbered 01-3f with 00 wired to 0,
//     which are usable as normal registers but also are used for
//     communication

//   - 8 t(emporary) registers

//   - a p register to store the result of the MAC

//   - an index register that is optionally added to the memory address

//   - two external memory data ports, one holding the value to write,
//     one holding the latest one read

//   The registers from r and m are 24 bits each, signed.  The p
//   register (and the MAC block itself) is 42 bits, 27.15.

//   The m bank is used as the communication interface with the mixer
//   and adcs.  Once every sample the registers m20 to m2f are sent as
//   stereo values to the eight MELO ports.  Registers m30 to m33 are
//   sent to the two stereo DACs.  In addition the mixer outputs to
//   the MEG are loaded in registers m20 to m2f.  That bank also
//   communicates with lfos, with the prng and with the external
//   memory data ports.


//      LFO

//   24 LFO registers are available.  The LFO registers
//   internal counters are 22 bits wide.  The LSB of the register gives
//   the increment per sample, encoded in a special 3.5 format.
//   With scale = 3bits and v = 5bits,
//     step  = base[scale] + (v << shift[scale])
//     base  = { 0, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 }
//     shift = { 0,  0,  1,   2,   3,   4,    5,    6 }

//   The top 17 bits of the counter are extracted.  They are shifted
//   up by 0-3 bits (depending on s) and truncated at the top, then
//   the phase p selects a value to add to the state.  That gives the
//   final 17-bits state which is shaped according to the type:

//   0: sine
//   1: triangle
//   2: saw upwards
//   3: saw downwards

//   The final 16 bits value is then shifted by 7 bits to generate the
//   final positive 23-bits value.

//   Writes to the MEG/LFO register changes phase, type and shift
//   immediatly but doesn't change the increment yet.  Writing then to
//   the commit register sets all the delayed increment changes
//   simultaneously.  This allows to keep the counters from
//   independant LFOs in sync.


//      Reverb ram access

 //   8 mappings can be setup, which allow to manage rotating buffers in
//   the samples ram easily by automating masking and offset adding.  The
//   register format is: pppppsss oooooooo.  'p' is the base pc/12 at
//   which the map starts to be used.  's' is the sub-buffer size,
//   defined as 1 << (10+s).  The base offset is o << 10.  There are no
//   alignment issues, e.g. you can have a buffer at 0x28000 which is
//   0x10000 samples long.

//    S = disable dithering when copying from p

//   The instructions are VLIW, 64-bits wide.  The VLIW structure
//   means bits of the instruction are directly associated to
//   structures in the chip (muxes, etc) instead of the usual
//   instruction encoding of normal cpus.

//   Read ports are always active, but for the r and m ports if the
//   register number is 0 then the result is 0.

//   Write ports for r and m are disabled when the register number is
//   0.  T, index and mem write have explicit enable bits (D, B and C
//   respectively).  P write is disabled though the multiplier mode
//   and the A bit.  P is passthrough, e.g. if it's written to and
//   read in the same instruction the read value is the written value.

//   The m1 selector (P) chooses between the instruction-associated
//   constant and a T register.  Optionally the value can be expanded
//   from floating-point to linear (Q).  The m2 selector chooses
//   between the r and m read ports (R).  m1 and m2 are combined in
//   the multiplier block, which can multiply them together, or pass
//   m1, or pass m2 (4th case disables the write to p).

//   The a selector (N) can choose between outputting 0, m, r, p, or
//   if r or m is selected but the register number is 0, then p >> 15.
//   Then the result of the multiplier and the a selector are combined
//   in the adder, through one of four operations: add a and m, sub a
//   from m, add m to abs(a) and binary and between m and a.  Then a
//   shifter left shifts the result by 0, 1, 2 or 4 bits. Finally a
//   saturation method may be applied (K) before writing to p.  After
//   p a dither is optionally applied (S) before the value is
//   distributed to the other registers.


//   MEG quarter-sine "ROM"

//   Pretty sure it's actually a computation given how imprecise it
//   actually is (a rom would have no reason not to be perfect).  But
//   guessing what calculation gives the correct pattern of
//   imprecision is not trivial.
